# Github Explorer

### Howdy! Welcome to Github Explorer!

This is a simples React project and yes, I'm redoing it. 
I've done it some months ago, as a part of Rocketseat's Bootcamp (GoStack).

Now, March of 2021, I'm updating some concepts and learning again!

This project works like a Create React App, but in a simpler way, more
"atomicaly". Both W were manually configurated.

Well, that's all folks! Enjoy!
